First Project for GitHub! 

Hello! 

My school major did not stress how important a github/portfolio was for a software career. I thought I should get started. This will be the first of many projects that I will link to github. This one will be in development for a while as I always need to switch from learning one technology to another.

I have had experience using jQuery/Ajax/ and python to build a dashboard for my internship at Bombardier, I thought it might be worthwhile for me to focus on a web development project using the most popular technologies, such as React!

Comments on improvements would be appercieated!
